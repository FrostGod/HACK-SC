0	5720	Do you guys know about the Putnam?
5720	8760	It's a math competition for undergraduate students.
8760	12760	It's a six hour long test that just has 12 questions broken up into two different three
12760	13760	hour sessions.
13760	17960	And each one of those questions is scored 1-10, so the highest possible score would
17960	19760	be 120.
19760	23800	And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking this thing each year are those who
23800	29160	clearly are already pretty interested in math, the median score tends to be around 1-2.
29160	31480	So it's a hard test.
31480	35880	And on each one of those sections of six questions, the problems tend to get harder as you go
35880	40240	from one to six, although of course difficulty is in the eye of the beholder.
40240	44120	But the thing about those fives and sixes is that even though they're positioned as
44120	48680	the hardest problems on a famously hard test, quite often these are the ones with the most
48680	50600	elegant solutions available.
50600	56200	Some subtle shift in perspective that transforms it from very challenging to doable.
56200	59400	Here I'm going to share with you one problem that came up as the sixth question on one
59400	60840	of these tests a while back.
60840	64280	And those of you who follow the channel, you know that rather than just jumping straight
64280	68240	to the solution, which in this case would be surprisingly short, when possible I like
68240	72880	to take the time to walk you through how you might have stumbled across the solution yourself,
72880	74480	where the insight comes from.
74480	78640	That is, make a video more about the problem solving process than about the problem used
78640	80360	to exemplify it.
80360	81880	So anyway, here's the question.
81880	86880	If you choose four random points on a sphere and consider the tetrahedron with these points
86880	93560	as its vertices, what is the probability that the center of the sphere is inside that tetrahedron?
93560	97640	Go ahead, take a moment and kind of digest this question.
97640	101320	You might start thinking about which of these tetrahedra contain the sphere's center,
101320	105640	which ones don't, how you might systematically distinguish the two.
105640	108640	And how do you even approach a problem like this, right?
108640	110040	Where do you even start?
111040	114800	Well, it's usually a good idea to think about simpler cases, so let's knock things down
114800	120240	to two dimensions, where you'll choose three random points on a circle, and it's always
120240	124480	helpful to name things, so let's call these guys P1, P2, and P3.
124480	129280	The question is, what's the probability that the triangle formed by these points contains
129280	131040	the center of the circle?
134720	139120	I think you'll agree it's way easier to visualize now, but it's still a hard question.
139120	142600	So again, you ask, is there a way to simplify what's going on?
142600	145720	Get ourselves to some kind of foothold that we can build up from.
145720	150560	Well, maybe you imagine fixing P1 and P2 in place, and only letting that third point
150560	151560	vary.
151560	154760	And when you do this, and you play around with it in your mind, you might notice that
154760	159440	there's a special region, a certain arc, where when P3 is in that arc, the triangle
159440	162000	contains the center, otherwise not.
162000	167240	Specifically, if you draw lines from P1 and P2 through the center, these lines divide
167240	172280	up the circle into four different arcs, and if P3 happens to be in the one on the opposite
172280	177760	side as P1 and P2, the triangle has the center, if it's in any of the other arcs, though,
177760	178760	no luck.
178760	184760	We're assuming here that all of the points of the circle are equally likely.
184760	188160	So what is the probability that P3 lands in that arc?
188160	193400	It's the length of that arc divided by the full circumference of the circle, the proportion
193400	195960	of the circle that this arc makes up.
195960	197720	So what is that proportion?
197720	199880	Obviously that depends on where you put the first two points.
199880	204240	I mean, if they're 90 degrees apart from each other, then the relevant arc is one-quarter
204240	205640	of the circle.
205640	208840	But if those two points were farther apart, that proportion would be something closer
208840	213960	to a half, and if they were really close together, that proportion gets closer to zero.
213960	215960	So think about this for a moment.
215960	220800	P1 and P2 are chosen randomly, with every point on the circle being equally likely.
220800	226480	So what is the average size of this relevant arc?
226480	231800	Maybe imagine fixing P1 in place, and just considering all the places that P2 might be.
231800	236680	All of the possible angles between these two lines, every angle from 0 degrees up to 180
236680	238920	degrees, is equally likely.
238920	245400	So every proportion between 0 and 0.5 is equally likely, and that means that the average proportion
245400	248280	is 0.25.
248280	253240	So if the average size of this arc is a quarter of the full circle, the average probability
253240	258080	that the third point lands in it is a quarter, and that means that the overall probability
258080	266800	that our triangle contains the center is a quarter.
266800	269840	But can we extend this into the three-dimensional case?
269840	274480	If you imagine three out of those four points just being fixed in place, which points of
274480	279200	the sphere can the fourth one be on, so that the tetrahedron that they form, contain the
279200	281840	center of the sphere?
281840	285200	Just like before, let's go ahead and draw some lines from each of those fixed three
285200	289840	points through the center of the sphere, and here it's also helpful if we draw some planes
289840	293280	that are determined by any pair of these lines.
293280	296960	Now what these planes do, you might notice, is divide the sphere into eight different
296960	301320	sections, each of which is a sort of spherical triangle.
301480	306480	And our tetrahedron is only going to contain the center of the sphere if the fourth point
306480	311560	is in the spherical triangle on the opposite side as the first three.
311560	316360	Now unlike the 2D case, it's pretty difficult to think about the average size of this section
316360	321400	as we let the initial three points vary.
321400	324800	Those of you with some multivariable calculus under your belt might think let's just try
324800	329080	a surface integral, and by all means pull out some paper and give it a try, but it's
329080	330080	not easy.
330080	333480	And of course it should be difficult, I mean this is the sixth problem on a Putnam, what
333480	335760	do you expect?
335760	339360	And what do you even do with that?
339360	343240	Well one thing you can do is back up to the two dimensional case and contemplate if there
343240	346920	is a different way to think about the same answer that we got.
346920	351280	That answer, one fourth, looks suspiciously clean, and it raises the question of what
351280	353800	that four represents.
353800	357080	One of the main reasons I wanted to make a video about this particular problem is that
357080	361900	what's about to happen carries with it a broader lesson for mathematical problem solving.
361900	366040	Think about those two lines that we drew for P1 and P2 through the origin.
366040	370160	They made the problem a lot easier to think about, and in general, whenever you've added
370160	374960	something to the problem setup that makes it conceptually easier, see if you can reframe
374960	378960	the entire question in terms of those things that you just added.
378960	385120	In this case, rather than thinking about choosing three points randomly, start by saying choose
385120	388540	two random lines that pass through the circle center.
388540	392080	For each line, there's two possible points that it could correspond to, so just flip
392080	396520	a coin for each one to choose which of the endpoints is going to be P1, and likewise
396520	399560	for the other, which endpoint is going to be P2.
399560	403360	Choosing a random line and flipping a coin like this is the same thing as choosing a
403360	407680	random point on the circle, it just feels a little bit convoluted at first.
407680	411360	But the reason for thinking about the random process this way is that things are actually
411360	412960	about to become easier.
413520	418160	We'll still think about that third point P3 as just being a random point on the circle,
418160	423680	but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin flips, because you see, once
423680	428200	the two lines and that third point are set in stone, there's only four possibilities
428200	433840	for where P1 and P2 might end up, based on those coin flips, each one being equally likely.
433840	439560	But one and only one of those four outcomes leaves P1 and P2 on the opposite side of the
439560	444000	circle as P3, with the triangle that they form containing the center.
444000	448520	So no matter where those two lines end up and where that P3 ends up, it's always a
448520	453320	one-fourth chance that the coin flips leave us with a triangle containing the center.
455720	457120	Now that's very subtle.
457120	461600	Just by reframing how we think about the random process for choosing points, the answer one
461600	465440	quarter popped out in a very different way from how it did before.
465440	471200	And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly up into three dimensions.
471200	476520	Again, instead of starting off by picking four random points, imagine choosing three random
476520	483480	lines through the center of the sphere, and then some random point for P4.
483480	487120	That first line passes through the sphere at two points, so flip a coin to decide which
487120	489520	of those two points is going to be P1.
489520	495280	Likewise, for each of the other lines, flip a coin to decide where P2 and P3 end up.
495280	499840	Now there's eight equally likely outcomes of those coin flips, but one and only one
499840	506440	of them is going to place P1, P2, and P3 on the opposite side of the center as P4.
506440	511800	So one and only one of these eight equally likely outcomes gives us a tetrahedron that
511800	513920	contains the center.
513920	520880	Again, it's kind of subtle how that pops out to us, but isn't that elegant?
520880	524640	This is a valid solution to the problem, but admittedly the way that I've stated it so
524640	527480	far rests on some visual intuition.
527480	530600	If you're curious about how you might write it up in a way that doesn't rely on visual
530600	534320	intuition, I've left a link in the description to one such write-up in the language of linear
534320	536440	algebra if you're curious.
536440	541280	And this is pretty common in math, where having the key insight and understanding is one thing,
541280	546000	but having the relevant background to articulate that understanding more formally is almost
546000	550280	a separate muscle entirely, one that undergraduate math students kind of spend most of their
550280	552280	time building up.
552280	557480	But the main takeaway here is not the solution itself, but how you might find that key insight
557480	560320	if it was put in front of you and you were just left to solve it.
560320	564280	Namely, just keep asking simpler versions of the question until you can get some kind
564280	565520	of foothold.
565520	570560	And then when you do, if there's any kind of added construct that proves to be useful,
570560	575760	see if you can reframe the whole question around that new construct.
575760	579240	To close things off here, I've got another probability puzzle, one that comes from this
579240	581520	video sponsor, Brilliant.org.
581520	585120	Suppose that you have eight students sitting in a circle taking the puttnam.
585120	589360	It's a hard test, so each student tries to cheat off of his neighbor, choosing randomly
589360	591680	which neighbor to cheat from.
591680	596960	Now circle all of the students that don't have somebody cheating off of their test.
596960	600240	What is the expected number of such circled students?
600240	603440	It's an interesting question, right?
603440	607120	Brilliant.org is a site where you can practice your problem-solving abilities with questions
607120	611080	like this and many, many more, and that really is the best way to learn.
611080	614640	You're going to find countless interesting questions curated in a pretty thoughtful way
614640	618160	so that you really do come away better at problem-solving.
618160	621880	If you want more probability, they have a really good course on probability, but they've
621880	625080	got all sorts of other math and science as well, so you're almost certainly going to
625080	626760	find something that interests you.
626760	627760	Me?
627760	632920	I've been a fan for a while, and if you go to Brilliant.org slash 3B1B, it lets them know
632920	638700	that you came from here, and the first 256 of you to visit that link can get 20% off their
638700	642320	premium membership, which is the one I use if you want to upgrade.
642320	646800	Also, if you're just itching to see a solution to this puzzle, which, by the way, uses a
646800	651160	certain tactic and probability that's useful in a lot of other circumstances, I also left
651160	653720	a link in the description that just jumps you straight to the solution.
668720	669720	Thank you.
669720	670720	Bye.
670720	671720	Bye.
671720	671740	Bye.
